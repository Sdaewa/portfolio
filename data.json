        "description": "Having studied telecom engineering and psychology, I have previously worked with one of my passions, cycling and bikes.Playing around with some Arduino and coding since 2015, I decided to take it seriously in 2019; that's when I graduated from LeWagon bootcamp in London. Since then I have about 2 years and a half of studying more, building a ton of projects, learning about the open-source community, exploring CyberSec, VMs, OSINT, Linux, etc. Currently, I am working as a Full stack developer; and had discovered that I really enjoy building bespoke tools, analytical and data-intensive apps",
